                profound advice? What words would be most important for you to
                remember throughout your entire life? What drives you, gives
                your life meaning? Without being genuine to yourself you are
                unable to be genuine to anyone else.

                <p className="statement-para">
                  Love yourself. Youâ€™re the only person in this life that will
                  be with you no matter what. Take care of yourself, respect
                  yourself, better yourself. Learn to be on your own and be
                  happy with yourself. Youâ€™re deserving of everything you want
                  out of life, and anyone who gets in the way of that is not
                  worth keeping around.

                  Remember that while attaining absolute perfection will never
                  happen, striving to get as close to it as possible, to reach
                  the highest heights you could possibly go will always be worth
                  the effort. Always look to kaizen for inspiration and
                  guidance, the Japanese philosophy of changing for the better
                  and continuous improvement. Seek to be better than your
                  previous self every single day, even if in the most minuscule
                  of ways, even if only by 1%. Continuous growth does not always
                  occur upward. There will be periods of lows and setbacks, but
                  as long as youâ€™re improving in the long run, consider your
                  growth a success. Stop comparing yourself to others.
                </p>
                <p className="statement-para">
                  Never stop learning, and never close yourself off in terms of
                  personal growth. Stay true to your convictions, but be
                  receptive to personal change and always keep an open mind.
                  Truly love and serve those closest to you. Live each day in
                  line with the ideal person you envision yourself to be.
                </p>
                <p className="statement-para">
                  Remember that the feelings of sadness and emptiness will not
                  last forever. Be grateful for all the blessings in your life
                  and do your best to remain positive, no matter the situation
                  or environment. On that same note, realize that much of life
                  is suffering and misery, and thatâ€™s okay. Learn to be okay
                  with being sad. Try your best to let your mind be at ease when
                  dealing with anxiety. Believe that everything will be okay.
