The Blueprint is a tool that allows you to organize your relationships, goals, and personal life. Craft the life you've always wanted to live and be your best self every single day! This project has been my favorite to build, as it's a tool I use for my own life. While built for my own personal use, this app utilizes Firebase authentication and Firestore database so that others may try it out and see if it benefits them as much as it has myself. I plan on continually adding new features and updating it over time as my main passion project. There's still much to be done, as there always is :)
